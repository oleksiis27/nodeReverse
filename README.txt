NodeReverse

A simple Java project demonstrating how to implement and reverse a singly linked list.

This project contains two main files:

Noda.java
Represents a node in a singly linked list, holding:
An integer data field (data)
A reference to the next node (next)
Includes methods to:
print all elements of the list
reverse the entire list in place and return the new head

Main.java
Demonstrates how to create a list of Noda objects
Shows how to use Noda.print() and Noda.reverse()

Features
Print Method
Iterates through the linked list and prints each nodeâ€™s data.

Reverse Method
Reverses the pointers in the linked list so the last node becomes the head.
